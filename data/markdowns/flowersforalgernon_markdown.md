r.  Strauss  says  I  shud  rite  down  what  I  think  and  evrey  thing  that 
happins to me from now on. I dont know why but he says its importint 
so  they  will  see  if  they  will  use  me.  I  hope  they  use  me.  Miss  Kinnian says 
maybe  they  can  make  me  smart.  I  want  to  be  smart.  My  name  is  Charlie 
Gordon. I am 37 years old and 2 weeks ago was my brithday. I have nuthing 
more to  rite  now  so  I will  close for  today. 

progris  riport 2-martch 6 
I  had  a  test  today.  I  think  I faled  it.  and  I  think  that  maybe  now  they  wont 
use me. What happind is a nice young man was in the room and he had some 
white cards with ink spillled  all  over them.  He  sed  Charlie what do  you  see 
on this card.  I  was  very  skared even  tho I  had  my  rabits foot  in  my  pockit 
because when I was a kid  I always faled  tests in school and I spillled ink  to. 
I told him I saw a  inkblot. He said yes and it  made me feel  good.  I thot 
that  was all  but  when  I got  up  to go  he  stopped  me.  He  said  now  sit  down 
Charlie we are not thru yet. Then I dont remember so good but he wan tid me 
to say what was in the ink. I dint see nuthing in the ink but he said there was 
picturs there other pepul saw some picturs. I coudnt see  any picturs. I reely 
tryed  to see.  I held the card close  up and  then far away. Then I said  if 1 had 
my glases I coud see  better I usally only ware my glases in the  movies or TV 
but 1 said they are in the closh in  the hall.  I got them. Then I said  let  me see 
that card agen  I bet  III  find  it  now. 

I tryed hard but I still coudnt find  the picturs I only saw the ink. 1 told 
him maybe 1 need  new glases.  He  rote somthing down on a  paper and I got 
skared of faling the test. I told him it was a very nice inkblot with littel points 
all  around the eges.  He looked very sad so that wasnt it.  I said please let  me 
try agen. III get it in a few  minits becaus 1m not so fast somtimes. 1m  a slow 
reeder too  in Miss  Kinnians class for  slow adults  but I'm  trying very  hard. 
He gave me a chance with another card that had 2 kinds of ink  spilled 

on it  red and  blue. 

He  was  very  nice  and  talked  slow  like  Miss  Kinnian  does  and  he  ex­
planed  it  to  me  that it was a  raw shok.  He  said  pepul  see  things in  the ink. 
I  said  show  me  where.  He  said  think.  I  told  him  I  think  a  inkblot  but  that 
wasnt  rite  eather.  He  said  what  does  it  remind  you-pretend something.  1 
closd my eyes for a long time to pretend. I told him I pretend a fowntan pen 
with ink  leeking  all  over  a  table cloth.  Then  he got  up  and  went  out. 

1 dont  think  I  passd  the raw shok  test. 

progris  report  3-martch  7 
Dr Strauss and Dr  Nemur say  it  dont matter about  the  inkblots.  I told  them 
I dint spill the ink on the cards and I coudnt see anything in the ink. They said 

285

ALGERNON 

that maybe they will still use me. I said Miss Kinnian never gave me tests like 
that one only spelling and reading. They said Miss Kinnian told that I was her 
bestist  pupil  in  the  adult  nite  scool  becaus  I  tryed  the  hardist  and  I  reely 
wantid  to  lern. They said  how come you  went to  the  adult  nite  scool  all  by 
yourself Charlie. How did you  find  it.  I said  I askd pepul and  sumbody told 
me where I shud go to lern to read and spell good. They said why did you want 
to.  I told them becaus all  my life I wantid to  be smart and not dumb. But its 
very hard to be smart. They said you know it will probly be tempirery. I said 
yes.  Miss  Kinnian told  me.  I dont  care if it  herts. 

Later I  had  more crazy tests today.  The  nice  lady  who gave  it  me told 
me the name and I asked her how do you spellit so I can rite it in my progris 
riport. THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST. I dont know the frist 2 words but I know 
what test  means. You got to pass it or you get bad marks. This test lookd easy 
becaus I coud see the picturs. Only this time she dint want me to tell  her the 
picturs. That mixd me up. I said the man yesterday said I shoud tell him what 
I saw in the ink she said that dont make no difrence. She said make up storys 
about the pepul  in  the  picturs. 

I told her how can you tell storys about pepul you never met.  I said why 

shud  I  make up lies.  I  never tell  lies  any  more becaus I  always get  caut. 

She  told  me  this  test  and  the  other  one  the  raw-shok  was  for  getting 
personalty. I laffed  so  hard.  I said  how can you get  that thing from  inkblots 
and fotos. She got sore and put her picturs away. I dont care. It was siIy. I gess 
I  faled  that  test  too. 

Later some men  in  white coats took me to a difernt part of the hospitil 
and gave me a game to play. It was like a race with a white mouse. They called 
the mouse Algernon. Algernon was in a box with a lot of twists and turns like 
all-kinds of walls and they gave  me a pencil and a paper with lines and lots 
of boxes. On  one side it said START  and on the other end it said FINISH. They 
said  it  was amazed  and  that Algernon  and  me had  the same amazed  to do. 
I dint see how we could have the same amazed  if Algernon had a  box and I 
had a paper but I dint say nothing. Anyway there wasnt time because the race 
started. 

One of the men had a watch  he was trying to hide so I woudnt see it so 

I  tryed  not  to look  and  that made me nervus. 

Anyway that test  made me feel  worser than all the others because they 
did it over 10 times with difernt amazeds and Algernon won every time. I dint 
know  that  mice  were  so  smart.  Maybe  thats  because  Algernon  is  a  white 
mouse.  Maybe  white mice are smarter then  other mice. 

progris  riport  4-Mar 8 
Their going  to  use  me!  1m  so  exited  I  can  hardly  write.  Dr  Nemur  and  Dr 
Strauss had  a  argament  about  it  first.  Dr  Nemur was  in  the  office  when  Dr 
Strauss brot me  in.  Dr  Nemur was  worryed  about using me  but Dr Strauss 
told him Miss Kinnian rekemmended me the best from all the people who she 
was teaching. I like  Miss  Kinnian becaus shes a very smart teacher. And  she 
said  Charlie  your  going  to  have  a  second  chance.  If you  volenteer  for  this

experamenl you mite get  smart. They dont know if it  will  be perminint but 
theirs a chance. Thats why I said ok even when I was scared because she said 
it was an operashun. She said dont be scared Charlie you done so much with 
so  little  I  think you  deserv  it  most  of all. 

So I got scaird when Dr Nemur and Dr Strauss argud about it. Dr Strauss 
said I had something that was very good. He said I had a good motor-vation. 
I  never even  knew I  had that.  I felt  proud when  he said  that  not every body 
with an eye-q of 68  had  that  thing.  I  dont know  what it  is  or where I  got  it 
but he said Algernon had it too. Algernons motor-vation  is the cheese they put 
in his box.  But  it  cant be that because I  didnt eat  any cheese this week. 

Then he told Dr Nemur something I dint understand so while they were 

talking  I  wrote  down some  of the  words. 

He  said  Dr  Nemur I  know Charlie is  not  what you  had in mind  as the 
first of your new brede of intelek,Hr (coudnt get the word) superman. But most 
people  of  his  low  menr"'*  are  host~d'  and  uncoop'~~'  they  are  usualy  dull 
apath ,'0':  and  hard to reach. He has a good  natcher hes intristed and eager to 
please. 

Dr Nemur said remember he will be the first  human beeng ever to have 

his intelijence  trippled  by surgicle  meens. 

Dr Strauss said  exakly.  Look at  how well  hes  lerned  to read and write 
for his low mentel age its as grate an acheve H  as you and I lerning einstines 
therey of **vity without help. That shows the intenss motor-vation. Its com­
parat**  a  tremen~d' achev~d' I say we  use  Charlie. 

I dint get all the words and they were talking to fast  but it sounded like 

Dr Strauss was on  my side  and  like  the  other one wasnt. 

Then Dr Nemur nodded he said all right maybe your right.  We  will use 
Charlie.  When  he said  that  I  got  so exited  I jumped  up  and  shook  his  hand 
for being so good to me. I told him thank you doc you wont be sorry for giving 
me a  second chance.  And  I  mean it  like  I told  him.  After  the operashun 1m 
gonna try to  be smart.  1m  gonna try  awful  hard. 

progris  ript  5-Mar 10 
1m skared. Lots of people who work here and the nurses and the people who 
gave  me  the tests came to  bring me candy and wish  me  luck.  I hope  I have 
luck. I got my rabits foot and my lucky penny and my horse shoe. Only a black 
cat crossed  me when I was comming to the hospitil.  Dr Strauss says dont be 
supersitis Charlie this is sience. Anyway 1m  keeping my rabits foot  with me. 
I.asked  Dr Strauss if III  beat Algernon  in the  race  after the  operashun 
and  he  said  maybe. If the operashun works III  show that mouse I can be as 
smart as he  is.  Maybe smarter. Then  III  be  abel  to  read  better and  spell  the 
words good  and  know  lots of things  and  be like other people.  I  want to  be 
smart like other people. If it works perminint they will make everybody smart 
all over the  wurld. 

They dint give  me anything to eat this morning. I dont know what that 
eating has to do with getting smart. 1m very hungry and Dr Nemur took away

my box  of candy. That  Dr  Nemur is  a grouch.  Dr Strauss says I can have  it 
back after the operashun.  You  cant eat befor a  operashun ... 

progress  report 6-Mar 15 
The  operashun  dint  hurt.  He  did  it while  I  was  sleeping.  They  took  off  the 
bandijis from  my eyes and my head today so I can make a PROGRESS  REPORT. 
Dr Nemur who looked at some of my other ones says I spell PROGRESS wrong 
and he told me how to spell it and REPORT too. I got to try and remember that. 
I have a very bad memary for spelling. Dr Strauss says its ok to tell about 
all  the  things that  happin  to  me  but he  says  I shoud  tell  more about what I 
feel  and what I think. When I told him I dont know how to  think he said try. 
All  the  time  when  the  bandijis were  on  my  eyes  I  tryed  to  think.  Nothing 
happened.  I dont know what to  think about.  Maybe if I ask  him he will  tell 
me how I can think now that 1m suppose to get smart. What do smart people 
think about. Fancy things I suppose. I wish I knew some fancy things alredy. 

progress  report  7-mar 19 
Nothing  is  happining.  I  had  lots  of tests  and  different  kinds  of  races  with 
Algernon. I hate that mouse. He always beats me. Dr Strauss said I got to play 
those games. And he said some time I got to take those tests over again. Thse 
inkblots are stupid. And those pictures are stupid too. I like to draw a picture 
of a  man and a  woman but I wont  make  up  lies  about  people. 

I got a headache from trying to think so much. I that Dr Strauss was my 
frend but he dont help me. He dont tell me what to think or when III get smart. 
Miss Kinnian dint come to see me.  I think writing these progress reports are 
stupid  too. 

progress  report  8-Mar 23 
1m going back to work at the factery. They said it was better I shud go back 
to work but I cant tell anyone what the operashun was for and I have to come 
to the hospitil for an hour evry night after work. They are gonna pay me many 
every  month for  lerning to  be  smart. 

1m glad 1m going back to work because I miss my job and all  my frends 

and all  the  fun  we  have  there. 

Dr Strauss says I shud keep  writing things down but I dont have to do 
it every day just when I think of something or something speshul happins. He 
says dont get discoridged because it takes time and it  happins slow.  He says 
it took a long time with Algernon before he got 3 times smarter then he was 
before. Thats why Algernon beats me all the time because he had that opera· 
shun too. That makes me feel better. I coud probly do that amazed faster than 
a reglar mouse. Maybe some day III  beat Algernon.  Boy that would be some· 
thing.  So  far  Algernon  looks like  he  mite be smart perminent. 

Mar  25 
(I dont have to  write PROGRESS  REPORT  on top any more just when 
I hand it in once a week for Dr Nemur to read. I just have to put the date on.

We  had a  lot  of fun  at  the factery  today. Joe Carp said  hey  look where 
Charlie had his operashun what did they do Charlie put some brains in. I was 
going to tell him but I remembered Dr Strauss said no. Then Frank Reilly said 
what did  you do Charlie forget  your key and open your door  the  hard way. 
That made  me laft.  Their really  my friends  and  they  like  me. 

Sometimes somebody will  say  hey  look  at  Joe or  Frank  or George  he 
really pulled a Charlie Gordon. I dont know why they say that but they always 
laft. This morning Amos Borg who is the 4 man at Donnegans used my name 
when he shouted at Ernie the office boy.  Ernie lost a packige.  He said Ernie 
for god sake  what are you  trying to  be  a  Charlie Gordon.  I  dont  understand 
why he said  that.  I  never  lost  any  packiges. 

.'

Mar 28  Dr Strauss came to my room tonight to see why I dint come in like 
I  was suppose  to. I  told  him I  dont like to race with Algernon any more. He 
said I  dont have to  for a  while but I  shud come in.  He had a  present for  me 
only it  wasnt a present but just for  lend.  I  that it  was a  little television but it 
wasnt. He said I got  to turn it on when I go  to sleep. I said your kidding why 
shud I  turn it on when 1m going to sleep. Who ever herd of a  thing like that. 
But  he said  if I  want to get  smart I  got  to do what  he  says. I  told  him I  dint 
think I  was going to  get smart and he put his  hand on my sholder and said 
Charlie you dont know it yet but your getting smarter all the time. You wont 
notice for a while. I think he was just being nice to make me feel good because 
I  dont  look  any smarter. 

Oh  yes I  almost forgot.  I asked  him when I  can go  back to the  class at 
Miss Kinnians school. He said I wont go their. He said that soon Miss Kinnian 
will  come to the hospitil to start and teach me speshul. I  was mad at her for 
not comming to see me when I got the operashun but I  like her so maybe we 
will  be  frends  again . 

Mar 29  That crazy TV kept me up all night. How can I sleep with something 
yelling crazy things all night in my ears. And  the nutty pictures. Wow. I dont 
know what it says when 1m up so how am I going to know when 1m sleeping. 
Dr Strauss says its ok.  He says my brains are leming when I  sleep and 
that will help me when Miss Kinnian starts my lessons in the hospitl (only I 
found out it  isnt a  hospitil its a  labatory). I  think its all  crazy. If you can get 
smart when your sleeping why do people go to school. That thing I dont think 
will  work. I  use to  watch the  late  show and  the late late show  on TV  all  the 
time and it  never made me smart. Maybe you  have to  sleep while you watch 
it. 

PROGRESS  REPORT  9-April 3 

Dr Strauss showed me how to  keep  the TV  turned low so  now I can sleep.  I 
dont hear a thing. And  I still dont understand what it says. A few times I play 
it over in the morning to find out what I lerned when I was sleeping and I dont 
think so.  Miss Kinnian says Maybe its another langwidge or something. But 
most times it  sounds American. It talks so fast faster then even Miss Gold who 

290

ALGERNON 

? -­

was my teacher in  6 grade and I remember she talked so fast  I coudnt under­
stand  her. 

I  told  Dr Strauss what good  is  it to get smart in  my sleep.  I  want  to  be 
smart  when  1m  awake.  He  says  its  the  same  thing  and  I  have  two  minds. 
Theres the subconscious  and  the conscious  (thats how you spell  it).  And  one 
dont tell the other one what its doing. They dont even talk to each other. Thats 
why I dream. And boy have I been having crazy dreams. Wow. Ever since that 
night TV.  The late  late  late  late  late show. 

I forgot to ask him if it was only me or if everybody had those two minds. 
(I just  looked  up  the  word  in  the  dictionary  Dr Strauss gave  me.  The 
word is subconscious.  adj.  Of the nature of mental operations yet not present 
in consciousness; as,  subconscious conflict of desires.)  Theres more but I  still 
don't know what it  means. This isnt a very good dictionary for dumb people 
like  me. 

Anyway the headache is  from  the party. My  frends from the factery Joe 
Carp and Frank Reilly invited me to go with them to Muggsys Saloon for some 
drinks. I dont like to drink but they said we will  have lots of fun. I had a good 
time. 

Joe  Carp  said  I  shoud  show  the  girls  how  I  mop  out  the  toilet  in  the 
factory and he got me a mop. I showed them and everyone laffed when I told 
that  Mr Donnegan said  I  was the best janiter he ever had  because I  like  my 
job and do it good and never come late or miss a day except for my operashun. 
I  said  Miss  Kinnian  always  said  Charlie be proud of your job because 

you  do  it  good. 

Everybody laffed and we had a good time and they gave me lots of drinks 
and Joe said Charlie is a card when hes potted. I dont know what that means 
but everybody likes me and we have fun.  I cant wait to be smart like my best 
frends  Joe  Carp  and  Frank  Reilly. 

I donl  remember how the party was over but  I think  I  went out to buy 
a  newspaper and  coffe  for  Joe and  Frank  and  when  I  came back  there was 
no one their. I looked for them all over till late. Then I dont remember so good 
but I  think  I got  sleepy or sick.  A nice  cop  brot  me back  home. Thats  what 
my  landlady Mrs Flynn  says. 

But I got a headache and a  big lump on my head and black and blue all 
over. I think maybe I fell  but Joe Carp says it was the cop they beat up drunks 
some  times.  I  don't  think  so.  Miss  Kinnian  says  cops  are  to  help  people. 
Anyway I got a  bad headache and 1m  sick and  hurt all  over.  I dont  think III 
drink  anymore. 

April6 
I beat Algernon! I dint even know I beat him until Burt the tester told 
me.  Then  the  second  time  I  lost  because  I  got  so  exited  I  fell  off  the  chair 
before I  finished.  But  after  that  I  beat  him  8  more  times.  I  must be getting 
smart  to  beat  a  srnart  mouse  like  Algernon.  But  I  dont  feel  smarter. 

I wanted to race Algernon some more but Burt said thats enough for one 
day. They let me hold  him for a  minit. Hes not so bad.  Hes soft like a  ball of 
cotton. He blinks and when he opens his eyes their black and pink on the eges. 
I said can I feed  him  because I felt  bad  to  beat him and I  wanted  to  be

nice and  make frends.  Burt said  no Algernon is a  very specshul  mouse with 
an operashun like mine, and he was the first  of all  the animals to  stay smart 
so long. He told me Algernon is so smart that every day he has to solve a test 
to  get  his  food.  Its  a  thing  like  a  lock  on  a  door  that  changes  every  time 
Algernon goes in to eat so he has to Iern something new to get his food. That 
made me  sad  because  if  he coudnt  lern  he  woud  be  hungry. 

I dont think its right to make you pass a test to eat. How woud Dr Nemur 
like  it  to  have  to pass a  test  every  time he  wants to eat.  I  think III  be  frends 
with  Algernon. 

April 9  Tonight after work Miss  Kinnian was at the laboratory. She looked 
like  she  was glad  to  see  me but  scared.  I  told  her dont  worry Miss  Kinnian 
1m not smart yet and she laffed. She said I have confidence in you Charlie the 
way you struggled so hard to read and right better than all the others. At werst 
you  will  have  it  for  a  littel  wile  and  your doing somthing for  sience. 

We are reading a very hard book. I never read such a hard book before. 
Its  called  Robinson  Crusoe  about  a  man  who  gets  merooned  on  a  dessert 
Iland. Hes smart and figers out all kinds of things so he can have a house and 
food and hes a good swimmer. Only I feel  sorry because hes all  alone and has 
no frends. But I think their must be somebody else on the iland because theres 
a picture with his funny umbrella looking at footprints. 1 hope he gets a frend 
and  not  be lonly. 

April 10  Miss Kinnian teaches me to spell better. She says look at a word and 
close  your eyes and  say  it  over and over  until  you  remember. 1 have  lots of 
truble with through  that you say threw  and enough  and tough  that you dont 
say enew  and  tew.  You got  to say enuff and tuff.  Thats how I use  to  write it 
before 1 started  to  get  smart. 1m confused  but  Miss  Kinnian says  theres  no 
reason  in  spelling. 

Apr  14  Finished  Robinson Crusoe.  1  want  to  find  out  more  about  what 
happens  to  him  but Miss  Kinnian says  thats all  there is.  Why 

Apr 15  Miss  Kinnian  says  1m  leming  fast.  She  read  some  of the  Progress 
Reports and  she  looked  at me kind  of funny. She says 1m  a  fine  person and 
III  show  them  all.  1 asked  her why.  She  said  never  mind  but I  shoudnt feel 
bad  if I  find  out that  everybody isnt  nice  like  I  think. She said  for  a  person 
who god gave so little to you done more then a lot of people with brains they 
never even used.  1 said  all  my frends  are smart people but there good. They 
like me and they never did anything that wasnt nice. Then she got something 
in  her eye  and  she  had  to  run out to the ladys room. 

Apr  16  Today, I lerned, the comma}  this is a comma (,) a period, with a tail, 
Miss Kinnian, says its importent, because}  it  makes writing, better,  she said, 
somebody, coud lose, a lot of money, if a comma, isnt, in the, right place, I dont 
have,  any  money,  and  I  dont  see,  how  a  comma,  keeps  you,  from  losing it, 

But  she  says,  everybody,  uses  commas,  so  III  use,  them  too, 

292 
FLOWERS 
FOR 
ALGERNON 

Apr 17  I used  the comma wrong.  Its punctuation. Miss  Kinnian told  me  to 
look  up  long words in  the dictionary to  lern  to  spell  them.  I  said  whats the 
difference  if you  can  read  it  anyway.  She said  its  part of your education  so 
now on III look up all the words 1m not sure how to spell. It takes a long time 
to  write that way but I think  1m  remembering.  I only  have  to  look  up  once 
and after that I get it right.  Anyway thats how come I got the word punctua­
tion  right.  (Its  that  way  in  the  dictionary).  Miss  Kinnian  says  a  period  is 
punctuation too,  and  there  are lots of other marks to  lern.  I  told  her  I  thot 
all  the  periods had  to  have  tails but she said  no. 

You  got  to  mix  them  up,  she showed?  me"  how.  to  mix!  them(up,.  and 
now;  I can!  mix up all  kinds" of punctuation, in!  my writing? There, are lots! 
of rules?  to  lern;  but  1m  gettin'g them  in  my  head. 

One thing I?  like  about,  Dear Miss  Kinnian: (thats the way  it  goes  in  a 
business letter if I  ever go  into  business)  is  she,  always gives  me'  a  reason" 
when-I ask.  She's a gen'ius!  I wish!  I cou'd  be  smart"  like,  her; 

(Punctuation,  is;  fun!) 

April18  What a dope I  am!  I didn't even understand what she was talking 
about.  I  read  the grammar book  last  night  and  it  explanes the  whole  thing. 
Then  I saw it  was the same way  as  Miss  Kinnian  was trying to  tell  me,  but 
I didn't get it. I got up in  the middle of the night, and the whole thing straight­
ened  out in  my  mind. 

Miss Kinnian said that the TV working in my sleep helped out. She said 

I  reached  a  plateau.  Thats  like  the  flat  top  of a  hill. 

After  I  figgered  out  how  punctuation  worked,  I  read  over  all  myoid 
Progress  Reports  from  the  beginning.  Boy,  did  I  have  crazy  spelling  and 
punctuation! I told  Miss  Kinnian I ought to go over the pages and fix  all the 
mistakes but she said, "No,  Charlie,  Dr.  Nemur wants them just as they  are. 
That's why he let you keep them after they were photostated, to see your own 
progress.  You're coming along fast,  Charlie." 

That  made me feel  good. After the lesson I went down and played with 

Algernon.  We  don't race  any  more. 

April 20 
feels  empty  like  getting punched  and a  heartburn  at  the  same time. 

I feel  sick  inside.  Not  sick  like for a doctor, but inside my chest it 

I wasn't going to write about  it,  but I guess I got  to,  because it's impor­

tant.  Today was  the  first  time  I ever stayed  home from  work. 

Last  night Joe Carp and Frank Reilly invited  me to a party. There were 
lots of girls and some men from the factory. I remembered how sick I got last 
time I drank too much, so I told Joe I didn't want anything to drink. He gave 
me a plain Coke instead. It  ta'sted  funny,  but  I thought it  was just a bad taste 
in  my  mouth. 

We  had a lot of fun  for  a while. Joe said  I should dance with Ellen and 
she would teach me the steps. I fell  a few times and I couldn't understand why 
because no one else was dancing besides Ellen and me. And all the time I was 
tripping because  somebody's foot  was  always sticking out.

Then when I got up I saw the look on Joe's face  and it  gave me a funny 
feeling in my stomack. "He's a scream," one of the girls said. Everybody was 
laughing. 

Frank  said,  "I  ain't  laughed  so  much  since  we  sent  him  off  for  the 

newspaper that  night at  Muggsy's  and ditched  him." 

"Look  at  him.  His face  is  red." 
"He's blushing.  Charlie is  blushing." 
"Hey,  Ellen,  what'd  you  do  to  Charlie?  I  never  saw  him  act  like  that 

before." 

I didn't know what to do or where to turn. Everyone was looking at me 
and laughing and I felt naked. I wanted to hide myself. I ran out into the street 
and I threw up. Then I walked home. It's a funny thing I  never knew that Joe 
and Frank and the others liked to have me around all  the time to make fun 
of me. 

Now I  know what  it means when  they  say "to  pull  a  Charlie  Gordon." 
I'm ashamed. 

PROGRESS  REPORT  11 

April 21  Still didn't go into the factory. I told Mrs. Flynn my landlady to call 
and tell Mr.  Donnegan I  was  sick.  Mrs.  Flynn looks at me very funny  lately 
like  she's scared of me. 

I think it's a good thing about finding out how everybody laughs at me. 
I thought about it a lot. It's because I'm so dumb and I don't even know when 
I'm doing something dumb. People think it's funny when a dumb person can't 
do things the same way  they  can. 

Anyway, now I know I'm getting smarter every day. I know punctuation 
and I can spell good. I like to look up all the hard words in the dictionary and 
I remember them. I'm reading a lot now,  and Miss Kinnian says I  read very 
fast. Sometimes I even understand what I'm reading about, and it stays in my 
mind. There are times when I  can close  my eyes and think of a  page  and it 
all  comes back like  a  picture. 

Besides history, geography, and arithmetic, Miss Kinnian said I  should 
start to learn a few  foreign languages. Dr. Strauss gave me some more tapes 
to play while I sleep.  I still don't understand how that conscious and uncon­
scious  mind  works,  but  Dr.  Strauss says  not  to  worry yet.  He asked  me to 
promise that when I start learning college subjects next week I wouldn't read 
any  books on psychology-that is,  until he  gives  me  permission. 

I feel a lot better today, but I guess I'm still a little angry that all the time 
people were laughing and making fun of me because I wasn't so smart. When 
I become intelligent like Dr. Strauss says, with three times my LO. of 68, then 
maybe I'll  be  like  everyone else and  people will  like  me and be friendly. 

I'm  not  sure  what  an  LO.  is.  Dr.  Nemur  said  it  was  something  that 
measured  how  intelligent  you  were-like  a  scale  in  the  drugstore  weighs 
pounds. But Dr. Strauss had a big argument with him and said an LO. didn't 
weigh intelligence at all.  He said an LO.  showed how much intelligence you 

294 
FLOWERS 

FOR 

ALGERNON 


could get,  like the numbers on the outside of a  measuring cup. You  still had 
to  fill  the  cup up with stuff. 

Then when I asked  Burt, who gives me my intelligence tests and works 
with Algernon,  he said that both of them were wrong (only I  had to promise 
not to tell them he said so). Burt says that the 1.0. measures a lot of different 
things including some of the things you learned already, and it really isn't any 
good  at  all. 

So I still don't know what LO.  is except that mine is going to be over 200 
soon.  I  didn't want to  say  anything,  but I  don't  see  how  if  they  don't  know 
what it  is,  or where  it  is-I don't see  how they know how much  of it  you've 
got. 

Dr. Nemur says I have to take a Rorshach Test  tomorrow. I wonder what 

,-:.1;:  ' 

,~ . 

that  is. 

April  22 
I  found  out  what  a  Rorshach  is.  It's  the  test  I  took  before  the 
operation-the one with  the  inkblots on  the  pieces  of cardboard.  The  man 
who gave  me the  test  was the  same one. 

I was scared to death of those inkblots.  I knew he was going to ask me 
to find the pictures and I knew I wouldn't be able to. I was thinking to myself, 
if only  there was some way  of knowing what  kind  of pictures were  hidden 
there. Maybe there weren't any pictures at all. Maybe it was just a trick to see 
if I was dumb enough to look for something that wasn't there. Just thinking 
about  that made  me sore  at  him. 

"All right, Charlie," he said, "you've seen these cards before, remember?" 
"Of course I  remember." 
The way I said  it,  he knew I was angry, and  he  looked surprised. "Yes, 
of course.  Now I want you  to look at this one. What might this be?  What do 
you see on this card? People see all  sorts of things in these inkblots. Tell me 
what it  might be  for  you-what it  makes you  think  of." 

I was shocked. That wasn't what I  had expected  him to say at all. "You 

mean  there are no  pictures  hidden  in  those inkblots?" 
He  frowned  and  took  off his glasses.  "What?" 
"Pictures. Hidden in  the inkblots.  Last time you  told  me that everyone 

could see  them  and you  wanted  me to find  them  too." 

He explained to me that the last time he had used almost the exact same 
words he was using now. I didn't believe it,  and I still have the suspicion that 
he  misled  me  at  the  time just  for  the  fun  of it.  Unless-I  don't  know  any 
more-could I  have been  that  feeble-minded? 

We went through the cards slowly. One of them looked like a pair of bats 
tugging at something. Another one looked like two men fencing with swords. 
I imagined all sorts of things. I guess I got carried away. But I didn't trust him 
any more,  and I kept turning them around  and even looking on the back to 
see if there was anything there I was supposed to catch. While he was making 
his notes, I peeked out of the corner of my eye to read it. But it was all in code 
that  looked  like  this:

The test still doesn't make sense to me. It seems to me that anyone could 
make up  lies about things  that they didn't really see.  How  could  he  know I 
wasn't making a fool of him by mentioning things that I didn't really imagine? 
Maybe  I'll  understand it when Dr.  Strauss lets  me  read  up  on  psychology. 

April25 
I figured out a new way to line up the machines in the factory, and 
Mr. Donnegan says it will save him ten thousand dollars a year in  labor and 
increased production.  He  gave  me  a  twenty-five-dollar  bonus. 

I wanted to take Joe Carp and Frank Reilly out to lunch to celebrate, but 
Joe  said  he  had  to  buy  some  things  for  his  wife,  and  Frank  said  he  was 
meeting his cousin for lunch. I guess it'll take a little time for them to get used 
to the changes in me.  Everybody seems to be frightened of me. When I went 
over  to  Amos  Borg  and  tapped  him  on  the  shoulder,  he  jumped  up  in  the 
air. 

People don't talk to me much any more or kid around the way they used 

to.  It makes the job kind  of lonely. 

April 27 
me tomorrow night to  celebrate my bonus. 

I got  up  the  nerve today to  ask  Miss Kinnian to have dinner with 

At  first she wasn't sure it was right,  but I  asked  Dr.  Strauss and he said 
it was okay. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur don't seem to be getting along so well. 
They're arguing all the time. This evening when I came in  to  ask Dr. Strauss 
about having dinner with Miss  Kinnian,  I  heard them shouting.  Dr.  Nemur 
was saying that it was his  experiment and his  research, and Dr. Strauss was 
shouting back that he contributed just as much, because he found me through 
Miss  Kinnian  and  he  performed  the  operation.  Dr.  Strauss said  that  some­
day  thousands of neurosurgeons  might  be  using  his  technique  all  over  the 
world. 

Dr.  Nemur wanted to publish the results of the experiment at the end of 
this month. Dr. Strauss wanted to wait a while longer to be sure. Dr. Strauss 
said that Dr. Nemur was more interested in the Chair of Psychology at Prince­
ton  than  he  was  in  the  experiment.  Dr.  Nemur  said  that  Dr.  Strauss  was 
nothing but an opportunist who was trying to ride to glory on his  coattails. 
When I left afterwards, I found  myself trembling. I don't know why for 
sure, but it was as if I'd seen both men clearly for the first  time. I  remember 
hearing Burt say that Dr.  Nemur had a shrew of a wife who was pushing him 
all the time to get things published so that he could become famous. Burt said 
that  the dream of her life  was to have a  big-shot  husband. 
Was  Dr.  Strauss really trying  to  ride on his coattails? 

I don't understand why I never noticed how beautiful Miss Kinnian 
April28 
really is.  She has brown eyes and feathery brown hair that comes to the top 
of her neck. She's only thirty-four! I think from the beginning I had the feeling 
that she was an unreachable genius-and very,  very  old.  Now,  every time I 
see  her she grows younger and  more lovely. 

We  had dinner and a long talk. When she said that I  was coming along 

so fast  that soon  I'd  be  leaving  her  behind,  I  laughed.

"It's true, Charlie. You're already a better reader that I am. You can read 
a  whole page at a glance while I can take in only a  few  lines at a  time.  And 
you remember every single thing you read.  I'm lucky if I can recall  the main 
thoughts and  the general  meaning." 

"I  don't feel  intelligent.  There  are  so  many things  I  don't  understand." 
She  took  out  a  cigarette  and  I  lit  it for  her.  "You've  got  to  be  a  little 
patient. You're accomplishing in days and weeks what it takes normal people 
to  do in  half a  lifetime. That's what makes it so  amazing. You're like a giant 
sponge now,  soaking things in.  Facts,  figures,  general knowledge.  And  soon 
you'll  begin  to  connect  them,  too.  You'll  see  how  the  different  branches of 
learning  are  related.  There  are  many  levels,  Charlie,  like  steps  on  a  giant 
ladder that take you up higher and higher to see more and more of the world 
around you. 

"I  can see  only a  little  bit of that, Charlie,  and  I  won't go  much higher 
than I am now, but you'll keep climbing up and up,  and see more and more, 
and each step will  open new worlds that you never even knew existed." She 
frowned.  "I  hope ... I just hope  to God-" 

"What?" 
"Never mind, Charles. Ijust hope I wasn't wrong to advise you to go into 

this  in  the first  place." 

I laughed. "How could that be? It worked, didn't it? Even Algernon is still 

smart." 

We sat there silently for a while and I knew what she was thinking about 
as she watched  me toying with  the chain of my rabbit's foot  and  my keys.  I 
didn't want to  think of that possibility any more than elderly people want to 
think  of  death.  I  knew  that  this  was only  the  beginning.  I  knew  what  she 
meant  about  levels  because  I'd  seen  some  of  them  already.  The  thought of 
leaving  her behind  made me  sad. 

I'm  in love with Miss Kinnian. 

PROGRESS REPORT  12 

I've quit my job with Donnegan's Plastic Box Company. Mr. Donne­

April30 
gan insisted that it would be better for all concerned  if I left. What did  I do 
to  make them  hate  me so? 

The first  I knew of it  was when Mr.  Donnegan showed me the  petition. 
Eight hundred and forty names, everyone connected with the factory, except 
Fanny Girden. Scanning the list quickly, I saw at once that hers was the only 
missing  name.  All  the  rest  demanded  that  I be fired. 

Joe  Carp  and  Frank  Reilly  wouldn't  talk  to  me  about  it.  No  one  else 
would either, except Fanny. She was one of the few people I'd known who set 
her mind  to  something and believed  it  no matter what  the rest  of the  world 
proved, said, or did-and Fanny did not believe that I should have been fired. 
She had  been against the petition  on  principle and  despite  the pressure and 
threats she'd  held  out. 

"Which  don't  mean  to  say,"  she  remarked,  "that  I  don't  think  there's 
something mighty strange about you,  Charlie. Them changes.  I don't  know.

You used to be a good, dependable, ordinary man-not too bright maybe, but 
honest. Who knows what you done to yourself to get so smart all of a sudden. 
Like  everybody  around  here's been saying,  Charlie,  it's  not  right." 

"But how can you say that,  Fanny? What's wrong with a man becoming 
intelligent and wanting to acquire knowledge and understanding of the world 
around  him?" 

She stared down at  her work and I  turned  to  leave.  Without looking at 
me, she said: "It was evil when Eve listened to the snake and ate from the tree 
of knowledge.  It  was  evil  when she saw  that she  was  naked.  If not for  that 
none of us  would  ever  have  to  grow old  and  sick,  and die." 

Once  again  now  I  have  the  feeling  of shame  burning  inside  me.  This 
intelligence has driven a  wedge between me and all  the people I  once knew 
and loved. Before, they laughed at me and despised me for my ignorance and 
dullness;  now,  they  hate  me for my knowledge and  understanding.  What in 
God's  name do  they  want of me? 

They've  driven  me  out  of the  factory.  Now  I'm  more  alone  than  ever 

before  ... 

May  15  Dr. Strauss is very angry at me for  not having written any progress 
reports in two weeks. He's justified because the lab is now paying me a regular 
salary.  I  told  him I  was too  busy  thinking and  reading.  When I  pointed  out 
that writing was such a slow process that it  made me impatient with my poor 
handwriting, he suggested that I learn to  type.  It's much easier to write now 
because I can type nearly seventy-five words a minute. Dr. Strauss continually 
reminds me of the need to speak and write simply so that people will be able 
to  understand  me. 

I'll try to  review  all  the things  that  happened to  me during the last two 

weeks. Algernon and I were presented to the American Psychological Associa­
tion sitting in convention with the World Psychological Association last Tues­
day.  We  created quite a  sensation. Dr.  Nemur and Dr. Strauss were proud of 
us. 

I suspect that Dr. Nemur, who is sixty-ten years older than Dr. Strauss 
-finds it necessary to see tangible results of his work. Undoubtedly the result 
of pressure by Mrs.  Nemur. 

Contrary to  my earlier impressions of him,  I  realize that  Dr.  Nemur is 
not at all a genius. He has a very good mind, but it struggles under the spectre 
of  self-doubt.  He  wants  people  to  take  him  for  a  genius.  Therefore,  it  is 
important for him to feel that his work is accepted by the world. I believe that 
Dr.  Nemur was afraid of further delay because he worried that someone else 
might  make  a  discovery along these  lines  and  take  the credit from  him. 

Dr.  Strauss on the other hand might be called a  genius,  although I feel 
that his areas of knowledge are too limited. He was educated in the tradition 
of narrow specialization; the broader aspects of background were  neglected 
far  more  than  necessary-even for  a  neurosurgeon. 

I  was  shocked  to  learn  that  the  only  ancient  languages  he could  read 

were Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and that he knows almost nothing of mathe­

298 
FLOWERS 
FOR 
ALGERNON 

matics beyond  the  elementary levels  of the calculus of variations.  When  he 
admitted this to  me,  I found  myself almost annoyed. It was as if he'd hidden 

this  part of himself in  order to  deceive  me,  pretending-as do  many people

I've  discovered-to  be  what  he  is  not.  No  one  I've  ever  known  is  what  he 
appears to  be on  the  surface. 

Dr.  Nemur appears to  be uncomfortable around  me.  Sometimes when 
I try to talk to him, he just looks at me strangely and turns away. I was angry 
at  first  when  Dr.  Strauss  told  me  I  was  giving  Dr.  Nemur  an  inferiority 
complex. I thought he was mocking me and I'm oversensitive at being made 
fun  of. 

How was I  to  know that a  highly respected  psychoexperimentalist like 
Nemur was unacquainted with Hindustani and Chinese? It's absurd when you 
consider the work that is being done in India and China today in the very field 
of his  study. 

I asked Dr. Strauss how Nemur could refute Rahajamati's attack on his 
method and results if Nemur couldn't even  read them in  the first  place. That 
strange look on Dr. Strauss' face can mean only one of two things. Either he 
doesn't  want  to  tell  Nemur  what  they're  saying  in  India,  or else-and  this 
worries me-Dr. Strauss doesn't know either. I must be careful  to speak and 
write  clearly and  simply so  that  people won't  laugh. 

May  J8 
I am very disturbed. I saw Miss Kinnian last night for the first time 
in over a week.  I tried to  avoid  all  discussions of intellectual concepts and to 
keep the conversation on a  simple,  everyday level,  but she just stared  at me 
blankly and asked me what I meant about the mathematical variance equiva­
lent  in  Dorbermann's Fifth  Concerto. 

When I tried to explain she stopped me and laughed. I guess I got angry, 
but I suspect  I'm  approaching her on the wrong level.  No  matter w~at I  try 
to discuss  with  her,  I  am unable to  communicate.  I  must  review Vrostadt's 
equations on Levels of Semantic Progression.  I find  that I don't communicate 
with people much any more. Thank God for books and music and things I can 
think about. I am alone in my apartment at Mrs. Flynn's boardinghouse most 
of the  time  and seldom  speak  to anyone.

I would not have noticed the new dishwasher, a boy of about sixteen, 
May 20 
at the corner diner where I take my evening meals if not for the incident of 
the  broken dishes. 

They  crashed  to  the  floor,  shattering  and  sending  bits  of  white  china 
under  the  tables.  The  boy  stood  there,  dazed  and  frightened,  holding  the 
empty  tray  in  his  hand.  The  whistles  and  catcalls  from  the  customers  (the 
cries of "hey, there go the profits!" ... "Mazeltov!" ... and "well, he didn't work 
here very long ..." which invariably seems to  follow the breaking of glass or 
dishware  in  a  public  restaurant)  all  seemed  to  confuse h im . . '  

When  the  owner carne to  see  what  the  excitement was about,  the  boy 
cowered  as  if  he  expected  to  be  struck and  threw up  his  anTIS  as  if  to  ward 
off  the  blow. 

"All right! All  right, you dope," shouted the owner, "don't just stand there!

Get  the broom and sweep  that  mess up. A broom. , . a broom, you idiot!  It's 
in  the kitchen.  Sweep  up  all  the pieces." 


The boy saw that he was not going to be punished. His frightened expres­

sion disappeared and he smiled and hummed as he came back with the broom 
to  sweep  the  floor.  A few  of  the  rowdier  customers  kept  up  the  remarks, 
amusing themselves at  his  expense. 


"Here,  sonny,  over here there's  a  nice  piece  behind you  ..." 

"C'mon,  do  it  again  .. ," 
"He's not so dumb.  It's  easier  to  break 'em  than to  wash 'em ..." 
As  his  vacant  eyes  moved  across  the  crowd  of  amused  onlookers,  he 
slowly mirrored their smiles and finally  broke into an uncertain grin at the 
joke which  he  obviously did  not  understand. 

I felt  sick inside as I  looked at  his dull,  vacuous smile,  the  wide,  bright 
eyes  of  a  child,  uncertain  but  eager  to  please.  They  were  laughing  at  him 
because  he was  mentally retarded. 

And  I  had  been  laughing at  him  too. 
Suddenly,  I  was furious  at  myself and all  those  who  were  smirking at 
him. I jumped up and shouted,  "Shut  up!  Leave  him alone!  It's  not his  fault 
he can't understand! He can't help what he is!  But for God's sake ... he's still 
a  human  being!" 

The room grew silent. I cursed myself for losing control and creating a 
scene. I tried not to look at the boy as I paid my check and walked out without 
touching  my food.  I  felt  ashamed  for  both of us. 

How  strange  it  is  that  people  of  honest  feelings  and  sensibility,  who 
would not take advantage of a man born without arms or legs or eyes-how 
such  people  think  nothing of abusing  a  man  born  with  low  intelligence.  It 
infuriated  me  to  think  that  not  too  long  ago  I,  like  this  boy,  had  foolishly 
played  the clown. 

And  I  had  almost forgotten. 
I'd  hidden  the  picture of the old  Charlie Gordon from  myself  because 
now that I was intelligent it was something that had to be pushed out of my 
mind. But today in looking at that boy, for the first time I saw what I had been. 
I  was just like  him! 

Only a  short  time ago,  I  learned  that people laughed at  me.  Now  I can 
see  that  unknowingly  I joined  with  them  in  laughing at  myself.  That  hurts 
most  of all. 

I  have  often  reread  my  progress  reports  and  seen  the  illiteracy,  the 
childish  naIvete,  the  mind  of  low  intelligence  peering  from  a  dark  room, 
through  the  keyhole,  at  the  dazzling  light  outside.  I  see  that  even  in  my 
dullness  I  knew  that  I  was  inferior,  and  that  other  people  had  something 
I  lacked-something denied  me.  In  my  mental  blindness,  I  thought  that  it 
was  somehow  connected  with  the  ability  to  read  and  write,  and  I  was 
sure  that  if  I  could  get  those  skills  I  would  automatically have  intelligence 
too. 

Even  a  feeble-minded  man wants  to  be  like  other men. 
A child may not know how to feed  itself, or what to eat, yet  it  knows of 

hunger.

This then is what I was like,  I never knew. Even with my gift of intellec­

tual  awareness,  I  never  really  knew. 

This day was good  for  me. Seeing the past more clearly, I  have decided 
to  use  my  knowledge  and  skills  to  work  in  the  field  of  increasing  human 
intelligence levels.  Who is better equipped for this work? Who else has lived 
in  both worlds? These are my people. Let me use my gift to do something for 
them. 

Tomorrow,  I  will  discuss  with  Dr.  Strauss the  manner in  which I  can 
work  in  this  area.  I  may  be  able  to  help  him  work  out  the  problems  of 
widespread use of the technique which was used  on  me.  I have several good 
ideas of my  own. 

There is  so  much that might be done with this technique. If I could be 

made into a genius, what about thousands of others like myself? What fantas­
tic  levels  might  be  achieved  by  using this  technique on  normal people?  On 
geniuses? 

There  are so  many doors  to  open.  I am  impatient to  begin. 

PROGRESS  REPORT  13 

May  23 
It happened today. Algernon bit me.  I visited  the lab to see  him as 
I  do  occasionally,  and  when  I  took  him out  of  his  cage,  he  snapped  at  my 
hand.  I  put  him  back  and  watched  him  for  a  while.  He  was  unusually  dis­
turbed  and vicious. 

May  24  Burt,  who  is  in  charge  of  the  experimental  animals,  tells  me that 
Algernon  is changing. He  is less co-operative; he refuses to run the maze any 
more; general motivation has decreased. And  he hasn't been eating. Everyone 
is  upset  about what  this  may  mean. 

May 25  They've been feeding Algernon, who now refuses to work the  shift­
ing-lock problem. Everyone identifies me with Algernon. In a way we're both 
the  first  of our kind.  They're  all  pretending that  Algernon's behavior is  not 
necessarily significant for me.  But it's hard to  hide the fact  that some of the 
other animals who were used in this experiment are showing strange behav­
lOr. 

Dr.  Strauss and  Dr.  Nemur have asked  me  not to  come to  the  lab  any 
more. I know what they're thinking but I can't accept it. I am going ahead with 
my plans to carry their research forward. With all due respect to both of these 
fine  scientists, I  am well aware of their limitations. If there is an answer, I'll 
have to find  it out for  myself. Suddenly, time  has become very important to 
me. 

May 29 
I have been given a lab of my own and permission to go ahead with 
the  research.  I'm  on  to  something.  Working  day  and  night.  I've  had  a  cot 
moved into the lab. Most of my writing time is spent on the notes which I keep 
in a separate folder,  but from time to time I feel  it necessary to put down my 
moods and  my thoughts out  of sheer habit.

I find  the  calculus of intelligence  to  be  a fascinating study.  Here is  the 
place for the application of all the knowledge I have acquired. In  a sense it's 
the problem I've  been concerned with  all  my life. 

May 31  Dr. Strauss thinks I'm working too hard. Dr. Nemur says I'm trying 
to cram a lifetime of research and thought into a few weeks. I know I should 
rest, but I'm driven on by something inside that won't let me stop. I've got to 
find  the reason for the sharp regression in Algernon. I've got to know if and 
when  it  will  happen  to  me. 

June  4 

LETTER  TO  DR.  STRAUSS  (copy) 
Dear  Dr.  Strauss: 

Under separate cover I am sending you a copy of my report entitled, 

"The  Algernon-Gordon  Effect:  A Study  of Structure  and  Function  of  In­
creased  Intelligence,"  which  I would  like  to  have  you  read  and  have pub­
lished. 

As  you  see,  my  experiments  are  completed.  I  have  included  in  my 
report all of my formulae, as well as mathematical analysis in the appendix. 
Of  course,  these should  be  verified. 

Because of its importance to both you and Dr. Nemur (and need I say 
to  myself,  too?)  I have checked and rechecked my results a dozen times in 
the hope of finding an error. I am sorry to  say the results must stand. Yet 
for the sake of science,  I am grateful for the little bit that I here add to the 
knowledge of the function  of the human mind  and of the  laws governing 
the  artificial  increase of human intelligence. 

I  recall  your  once  saying to  me  that  an  experimental  failure  or the 
disproving  of a theory was as important to  the advancement of learning as 
a success would be.  I know now that this is true. I am sorry, however,  that 
my own contribution to  the field  must rest upon the ashes of the work of 
two  men  I regard  so  highly. 

Yours  truly, 
Charles Gordon 

enc!.:  rept. 

I must not become emotional. The facts and the results of my experi­

June 5 
ments are clear,  and  the  more  sensational  aspects  of  my  own  rapid  climb 
cannot obscure the fact  that the tripling of intelligence by  the surgical tech­
nique developed  by  Drs.  Strauss and  Nemur must  be viewed  as having little 
or no  practical  applicability  (at  the  present  time)  to  the  increase  of human 
intelligence. 

As  I review the records and data on Algernon,  I see that although he is 
still  in  his  physical  infancy,  he  has  regressed  mentally.  Motor  activity  is 
impaired;  there  is  a  general  reduction of glandular activity;  there  is  an ac­
celerated  loss of co-ordination. 

There are also  strong indications of progressive amnesia. 
As  will  be  seen  by  my  report,  these  and  other  physical  and  mental 

302

ALGERNON 

deterioration syndromes can be predicted with statistically significant results 
by the  application  of my formula. 


The surgical stimulus to which we were both subjected  has resulted  in 
an  intensification  and  acceleration of all  mental  processes. The  unforeseen 
development, which I  have taken the  liberty of calling the Algernon-Gordon 
Effect,  is the logical extension of the entire intelligence speed-up. The hypoth­
esis here proven may be described simply in the following terms:  Artifically 
increased  intelligence deteriorates at a  rate of time  directly proportional to 
the quantity of the  increase. 

I  feel  that this,  in  itself,  is an  important discovery. 
As  long as I  am able to write, I  will  continue to record  my  thoughts in 

these progress reports. It is one of my few pleasures. However, by all indica­
tions,  my  own  mental  deterioration  will  be  very  rapid. 

I have already begun to notice signs of emotional instability and forget­

fulness,  the first  symptoms of the burnout. 

June 10  Deterioration progressing. I have become absent-minded. Algernon 
died two days ago. Dissection shows my predictions were right. His brain had 
decreased in weight and there was a general smoothing out of cerebral convo­
lutions as well  as a  deepening and broadening of brain fissures. 

I guess the same thing is or will  soon be happening to me. Now that it's 

definite,  I  don't want it  to happen. 

I  put Algernon's body in a cheese box and buried him in the back yard. 

I  cried. 

June  15  Dr. Strauss came to see  me again.  I wouldn't open the door and I 
told  him  to  go  away. I  want to be left to myself.  I  have  become touchy and 
irritable.  I  feel  the  darkness  closing  in.  It's  hard  to  throw  off  thoughts  of 
suicide. I keep telling myself how important this introspective jour·nal will be. 
It's a strange sensation to pick up a  book that you've read and enjoyed 
just a few months ago and discover that you don't remember it. I remembered 
how great I  thought John Milton was,  but when I  picked up Paradise Lost  I 
couldn't understand it at all. I got so angry I threw the book across the room. 
I've got to  try to  hold on to some of it.  Some of the things I've  learned. 

Oh,  God,  please don't take  it  all  away. 

June  19  Sometimes,  at  night,  I  go  out  for  a  walk.  Last  night  I  couldn't 
remember  where  I  lived.  A policeman  took  me  home.  I  have  the  strange 
feeling that this has all happened to me before-a long time ago. I keep telling 
myself I'm the only person in the world who can describe what's happening 
to  me. 

June  21  Why  can't I remember? I've got to fight.  I lie  in bed for days and I 
don't know who or where I am. Then it all comes back to me in a flash. Fugues 
of amnesia. Symptoms of senility-second childhood. I can watch them com­
ing on.  It's so cruelly logical.  I  learned so  much  and  so  fast.  Now  my  mind

is deteriorating rapidly. I won't let  it happen. I'll fight  it.  I can't help thinking 
of the boy in the restaurant, the blank expression, the silly smile,  the people 
laughing at  him.  No-please-not that  again ... 

June 22 
I'm forgetting things that I learned recently. It seems to be following 
the  classic  pattern-the last  things learned  are  the  first  things forgotten.  Or 
is  that  the  pattern?  I'd  better look  it  up  again .... 

I reread my  paper on the Algernon-Gordon Effect  and I get  the strange 
feeling  that  it  was  written  by  someone  else.  There  are  parts  I  don't  even 
understand. 

Motor  activity  impaired.  I  keep  tripping  over  things,  and  it  becomes 

increasingly  difficult  to  type. 

June  23 
I've given up  using the typewriter completely. My  co-ordination is 
bad. I feel  that I'm moving slower and slower.  Had a terrible shock today.  I 
picked up a copy of an article I used in my research, Krueger's Uber psychis­
che  Ganzheit,  to  see  if it would  help  me  understand what I had  done.  First 
I thought there was something wrong with my  eyes.  Then I realized I could 
no longer read  German.  I tested  myself in other languages.  All  gone. 

June  30  A week  since  I  dared  to  write  again.  It's  slipping  away  like  sand 
through my fingers.  Most  of the books I have are too  hard for me now.  I get 
angry with them because I know that I read and understood them just a few 
weeks ago. 

I keep telling myself I must keep writing these reports so that somebody 
will know what is happening to me. But it gets harder to form the words and 
remember spellings.  I  have  to  look  up  even  simple words  in the  dictionary 
now  and it  makes me  impatient with  myself. 

Dr.  Strauss comes around  almost  every day,  but  I told  him  I wouldn't 
see or speak to anybody. He feels guilty. They all do. But I don't blame anyone. 
I  knew what  might  happen.  But  how  it  hurts. 

July  7  I don't know where the week  went.  Todays Sunday I  know because 
I can see through my window people going to church. I think I stayed in bed 
all week but I remember Mrs.  Flynn bringing food to me a few  times. I keep 
saying over and over Ive got  to  do something but then I forget  or maybe its 
just easier  not  to  do what  I say 1m  going to  do. 

I think  of my  mother and  father a  lot  these  days.  I found  a  picture of 
them with me taken at a  beach.  My  father has a big ball under his arm and 
my  mother is holding me by the  hand.  I dont  remember them the way  they 
are in the picture.  All  I remember is  my  father  drunk  most of the time and 
arguing with  mom about  money. 

He never shaved much and he used to scratch my face when he hugged 
me.  My  mother said  he  died  but Cousin  Miltie  said  he  heard  his  mom and 
dad  say  that  my  father  ran  away  with  another  woman.  When  I  asked  my 
mother  she  slapped  my  face  and  said  my  father  was  dead.  I  dont  think  I 

304

ever found out which was true but 1 don't care much. (He said he was going 
to  take  me  to  see  cows on a  farm  once but he  never did.  He  never kept his 
promises ...)

July 10  My landlady Mrs Flynn is very worried about me. She says the way 
1 lay around all day and dont do anything 1 remind her of her son before she 
threw him out of the house. She said she doesn't like loafers. If 1m sick its one 
thing,  but if 1m  a  loafer thats another thing and she wont  have it.  1 told  her 
1 think 1m  sick. 

I try to read a little bit every day,  mostly stories, but sometimes 1 have 
to  read  the  same  thing  over  and  over  again  because 1 dont  know  what  it 
means.  And  its hard to  write.  I  know  I should look  up  all  the words in  the 
dictionary but its  so  hard and 1m  so  tired  all  the  time. 

Then I got  the idea that I would only use the easy words instead of the 
long hard ones. That saves time. 1 put flowers on Algernons grave about once 
a week. Mrs Flynn thinks 1m crazy to put flowers on a mouses grave but 1 told 
her that  Algernon  was special. 

July  14 
Its sunday again.  I dont have anything to do to  keep me busy now 
because my television set is  broke and 1 dont have any money to get it fixed. 
(I  think 1 lost  this  months check  from  the  lab.  I dont remember) 

I  get  awful  headaches  and  asperin  doesnt  help  me  much.  Mrs  Flynn 
knows  1m  really  sick  and  she  feels  very  sorry  for  me.  Shes  a  wonderful 
woman whenever someone is  sick. 

July 22  Mrs Flynn called a strange doctor to see  me.  She was afraid  I was 
going to die.  I  told  the doctor I wasnt  too  sick  and  that I  only forget  some­
times.  He  asked  me did  I have  any  friends  or relatives and I said  np 1 dont 
have any. I told him I had a friend called Algernon once but he was a mouse 
and  we  used  to  run  races  together.  He  looked  at  me  kind  of funny  like  he 
thought 1 was  crazy. 

He  smiled when I told  him  I used  to  be a genius.  He talked  to  me like 
I  was  a  baby  and  he  winked  at  Mrs  Flynn.  I got  mad  and  chased  him  out 
because  he was making fun  of me  the  way they all  used  to. 

July  24 
I  have  no  more  money  and  Mrs  Flynn  says  I  got  to  go  to  work 
somewhere and  pay  the  rent because  I  havent paid  for  over  two  months. 1 
dont  know  any  work  but  the job  I  used  to  have  at  Donnegans  Plastic  Box 
Company. I dont want to go back there because they all knew me when I was 
smart and maybe theylllaugh at me. But I dont know what else to  do to get 
money. 

July 25 
I was looking at some of myoid progress reports and its very funny 
but I cant read what I wrote. I can make out some of the words but they dont 
make sense. 

Miss Kinnian came to the door but I said go away I dont want to see you. 
She cried  and  I cried too but I wouldnt let  her in  because I didnt want her

to  laugh at  me.  1 told  her 1 didn't like  her any more.  I  told her 1 didnt want 
to be smart any more. Thats not true. I still love her and I still want to be smart 
but I  had to say that so shed  go away. She gave  Mrs Flynn money to pay the 
rent.  I  dont  want that.  1 got  to  get  a job. 

Please ... please  let  me not  forget  how to  read  and write ... 

July 27  Mr Donnegan was very  nice when I came back and asked  him for 
myoid job of janitor. First he  was very suspicious but I  told  him what hap­
pened to me then  he looked very sad  and  put  his hand on my shoulder and 
said  Charlie Gordon you got  guts. 

Everybody looked at me when I  came downstairs and started working 
in the toilet sweeping it out like I used to.  I  told  myself Charlie if they make 
fun of you dont get sore because you remember their not so smart as you once 
thot they were. And besides they were once your friends and if they laughed 
at  you  that doesnt  mean  anything because they  liked  you  too. 

One  of the  new  men  who came to  work  there after I  went  away  made 
a  nasty crack he  said  hey  Charlie 1 hear your a  very  smart fella  a  real quiz 
kid. Say something intelligent. I felt bad but Joe Carp came over and grabbed 
him by the shirt and said leave him alone you lousy cracker or III break your 
neck.  I  didnt expect Joe  to  take my  part  so  I  guess  hes  really  my  friend. 

Later Frank Reilly  came over and said Charlie if anybody  bothers you 
or trys to take advantage you call me or Joe and we will set em straight. I said 
thanks Frank and  I  got  choked  up  so  I  had  to  turn  around and go  into  the 
supply  room so  he  wouldnt see  me cry.  Its good  to  have  friends. 

July 28 
I did a dumb thing today I forgot  I wasnt in Miss Kinnians class at 
the adult center any more like I  use  to be.  I went in and sat down in myoId 
seat in the back of the room and she looked at me funny and she said Charles. 
I  dint remember she ever called  me that before only Charlie so I  said  hello 
Miss  Kinnian 1m  redy for  my lesin  today only I  lost  my  reader that  we  was 
using. She startid to cry and run out of the room and everybody looked at me 
and I  saw they  wasnt the same pepul  who used  to  be  in  my class. 

Then all of a suddin I remembered some things about the operashun and 
me getting smart and I  said holy smoke I  reely pulled a Charlie Gordon that 
time.  I  went away before she come back to  the  room. 

Thats why 1m  going away from  New York for good.  I  dont want to do 
nothing like  that  agen.  1 dont  want  Miss Kinnian to feel  sorry for  me.  Evry 
body  feels  sorry  at  the  factery  and  I  dont  want  that  eather  so  1m  going 
someplace where nobody knows that Charlie Gordon was once a genus and 
now  he  cant even  reed  a  book  or rite  good. 

1m taking a cuple of books along and even if I cant reed them III practise 
hard and  maybe I  wont forget  every  thing 1 lerned. If 1 try reel hard  maybe 
III  be a  littel bit smarter then I was before the operashun. 1 got my rabits foot 
and  my  luky  penny and  maybe  they  will  help  me. 

If you  ever  reed  this  Miss  Kinnian dont  be  sorry for  me 1m  glad  I  got 
a second chanse to be smart becaus I  lerned a  lot of things that I  never even 
new were in this world and 1m grateful that I saw it all for a litte! bit. I  dont 

306 

FLOWERS 
FOR 
ALGERNON 

know why 1m dumb agen or what I did wrong maybe its becaus I dint try hard 
enuff. But if I try and practis very hard maybe III  get a littl smarter and know 
what all  the words are. I remember a littel  bit how nice I  had a  feeling  with 
the blue book that has the torn cover when I red it. Thats why 1m gonna keep 
trying to get smart so I can have that feeling agen. Its a good feeling to know 
things and be smart. I wish I had it rite now if I did I would sit down and reed 
all  the  time.  Anyway  I bet 1m  the  first  dumb person  in  the  world  who ever 
found  out  somthing importent  for sience.  I  remember I  did  somthing but I 
dont remember what. So I gess its like I did it for all the dumb pepullike me. 
Good-by  Miss  Kinnian  and  Dr Strauss and  evreybody.  And  P.S.  please 
tell  Dr Nemur not to  be  such a  grouch when  pepul 1aff at  him and  he  woud 
have more frends. Its easy to make frends if you let pepul laff at you. 1m going 
to  have  lots of frends where I  go. 
P.P.S.  Please if you get a  chanse put some flowrs  on  Algernons grave  in  the 
bak yard  ...

Daniel  Keyes  is  essentially  a  one-story  author  in  the  science  fiction  field,  al­

though he has published around seven other works of fiction in the genre.  Born in New 
York City in  1927, he  received degrees from  Brooklyn  College in  1950 and  1961. He 
entered  the  publishing  field  as  an  editorial  associate  with  the  short-lived  Marvel 
Science Stories  in  1950.  He worked  at  the  magazine  until  1951, when  he  accepted 
a position with the Stadium  Publishing Company,  which he  left to go  into the photog­
raphy  business,  a venture that lasted  only one  year.  He then worked  as  a high  school 
English  teacher  in  Brooklyn,  a  position  he  held  until  1962  when  he  became  an 
instructor  of  English  at  Wayne  State  University  in  Detroit.  College  teaching  then 
became  his  vocation,  as  he  moved  to  Ohio University  in  1966 and  rose  thwugh  the 
academic  ranks,  and  he  is  currently  professor  of English  at  that  institution,  a rank  he 
achieved in  1972. He has also served as director of creative writing for several  periods 
during  his  career. 

He first  appeared  in  the science fiction  magazines with  "Precedent" in the  May 
1952  issue  of Marvel Science Stories,  and  published  at  least  two other  SF  stories  in 
the  early  1950s.  Aside  from  "Flowers  for  Algernon"  his  best  story  is  the  powerful 
"Crazy  Maro,"  first  published  in  The  Magazine  of Fantasy  and Science  Fiction  in 
April  1960,  a  work  that  remains  one  of  the  most  effective  treatments  of  racism  in 
science  fiction. 

His reputation rests  on  "Flowers for Algernon" (first published  in  The  Magazine 
of Fantasy and Science  Fiction  in  April  1959),  which won him a Hugo Award as  the 
best short story of 1959 (awarded in  1960) and  then,  in  its expanded  novel form, won 
the Nebula Award of the Science Fiction Writers of America as  the best novel of 1966, 
certainly  a  rare  distinction.  The  novel,  published  as  a mainstream  work  by  Harcourt 
Brace Jovanovich,  is  not  as  effective  as  the  story  version,  which  is  much  tighter  and 
written  from  a  very  successfully  executed  first-person  point  of  view. 

Both  versions  are  profound  works on  what  it  means  to  be  a genius  and  on  the 
dangers  of trying  to  improve  the  human  race.  The  novel  is  beautifully  written,  and 
certainly  belongs  in  any  library of modern science fiction.  One of its greatest  accom­

plishments  is  the fact that  it  presents  what some  might consider a tragedy  in  a moving 
fashion  without  being  overly  sentimental,  something  that  Char/v  the  1968  film  ver­
sion  starring  Cliff  Robertson  and  Claire  Bloom,  fails  to  avoid. 

Mr. Keyes has written two interesting mainstream novels,  The  Touch  (1968) and 
The  Fifth  Sally  (1980),  as  well  as  a well-researched  nonfiction  work,  The  Minds  of 
Billy  Milligan  (1981).
