"I have a creature with the following text: 
'Whenever Ghost of Ramirez DePietro deals combat damage to a player, 
choose up to one target card in a graveyard that was discarded or put there from a library this turn. 
Put that card into its owner's hand.' I have another creature with the text: 
'Whenever one or more Pirates you control deal damage to a player, Francisco explores.' 

Can I return a card put into my graveyard by the explore ability with the first ability? 
Ramirez is a pirate. "
