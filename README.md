## Features

- RAG-based query system using the entire MTG rules corpus (approximately 148,000 words)
- Integration with Reddit and Google search for additional context and community insights
- Multi-source answer compilation, presenting results from rules, Reddit, and Google searches
- Natural language processing for understanding and responding to MTG-specific queries
